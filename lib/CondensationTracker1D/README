Two Datasets: Set1 and Set2 are actual features from medical ultrasound data that I am working with. .gwd are ground truth data from manual marking of video frames. .pos data are noisy measurements of the features from another algorithm.

Measurements in .pos files are ordered based on their probability of 
being true, however this probability is not used by the algorithm.

Implementation is based on Realtime-tracker of 1D feature in clutter
